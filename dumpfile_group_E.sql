This year, they showcase 34 professionals across 5 categories – Social Impact, Small & Medium Business, Marketing & Advertising, Founder & CEO and Human Resources. \n\nThe Power Profiles remind us that we all have our own definition of success and we need to chart our own path. This is what makes us stand out from the rest. I hope these professionals will inspire you to pursue what you are in it for. It could be your family, to retire early, to make your parents proud or build your own business. I am in to challenge myself every day. Whatever you are in it for, there is a community of professionals who are in it together with you – to support you, guide you and connect you with the right people.\n\nRead the full post and list here: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6466095159795904512','1','11','2018'),

Centered on investigating the feasibility of reducing the number of questions in a psychological test without compromising the validity of the results.\n\nThe conclusions of this projects aim to answer the following reflection: it is preferable to maintain the number of original questions with ideally more valid results or to reduce the number of questions so that the user is more likely to take the test and maintain attention during the test despite theoretically not having full accuracy.\n\nTo answer this, deep learning and machine learning techniques are employed. The methodology includes researching the theory and basis of the most commonly used psychological tests, training different models with data open source data from a psychological test, using different feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant questions, and then training optimized models with a reduced number of features to compare the outcomes.\n\nFor more information, results, references and description of the project, please refer to the paper.

Our proposal relies on several innovative ideas to take advantage of existing LLMs to create engaging user experiences that are capable of handling real users in a scalable way and without compromising the competition rules. Different SotA dialogue generators were fine-tuned and incorporated to give variability and handling the wide range of topic conversations; we also developed mechanisms to control the quality of the responses (e.g., detecting and handling toxic interactions, keeping topic coherence, and increasing engagement by providing up-to-date information in a conversational style).\n\nIn addition, our system extends the capabilities of the Cobot architecture by in- corporating modules to automatically generate images, provide voice cloning capabilities with fictional characters, serve contextual sounds for detected entities in the dialogue, better capitalization and punctuation capabilities, and to provide natural expressions of interest.\n\nFinally, we also included a trained generative selector and a reference-free model for automatic evaluation of turns that could reduce latencies and complement the ranker’s capabilities to select the best generative answer.',NULL),

As less and less human cells are needed to perform the tasks of iterations the physical work will go to non-complaining 24/7 worker-robotics.

Breakthroughs of disruptive innovation in bio-nanotechnology and artificial intelligences projects carbon nanoparticle-organic robots that can cluster into solid exoskeleton shapes of any desired object, that is capable of performing any function that serves the needs of humankind (Kurzweil, 2005).\n\nPatterns are emerging that may suggest a direct correlation between industrial occupational downsizing, a term referring to an event when human cell jobs becomes replaced by automation; and its relationship to Kurzweil’s “Life Cycle of Innovation” to an asymptotic discreet value.
